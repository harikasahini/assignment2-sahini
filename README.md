# Prim's Algorithm

>Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph by starting with one of the edges with minimum weight and then trying to include the next minimum-weight edge from the rest of the edges while avoiding formation of any cycles.<br>
<https://efficientcodeblog.wordpress.com/2017/12/11/kruskals-algorithm-implementation/>

```
struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

int n;
vector<Edge> edges;

int cost = 0;
vector<int> tree_id(n);
vector<Edge> result;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    tree_id[i] = i;

sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

for (Edge e : edges) {
    if (tree_id[e.u] != tree_id[e.v]) {
        cost += e.weight;
        result.push_back(e);

        int old_id = tree_id[e.u], new_id = tree_id[e.v];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (tree_id[i] == old_id)
                tree_id[i] = new_id;
        }
    }
}
