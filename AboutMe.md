# HARIKA SAHINI
I am a ambitious girl whose world revolves around myself.
I always love to travel and explore places. This is the first time ever I moved away from my home to pursue Master's in United States which is 8000 miles away from my home country.Although I miss my family, I feel amazed about the progress in my career.
